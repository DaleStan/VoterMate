To run this, one must update the schema.xlsx file in VoterMate.BuildDatanase, typically by downloading it from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WucAc_FCfYeOLLP4hRwD2H3e3kvJjOyf3zU3j_l-Fnc/edit?gid=332175465#gid=332175465 and then run VoterMate.BuildDatabase on the computer, typically by tapping F5 or the green run arrow in Visual Studio. Then connect the Chuwi tablet to the computer with a type-C to type-C cable. This should cause the Chuwi tablet to be recognized as an Android devece and show up as an option to be run under the VoterMate drop down menu.
